Q1) Key takeway from the paper?
- By taking an analytical approach where "flaky tests" which are most common in code (e.g 77% of flaky tests fall in the three categories
of concurrecy, test-order-dependency, and ASYNC Wait) are indeitfied, developers could alleviate, if not resolve, the issues caused by 
flaky tests through early manifiestation and strategic countering of issues that may arise.


Q2) What is the motivation for this work (both people problem and technical problem), and its distillation into a research
question?

Non-deterministic "flaky tests" are a problematic in the software development field due to amount of time wasted by their un-fixed outcomes
and diffculty to debug as well as identify. Flaky tests are very common part of code and though somewhat troublesome they do provide
some converage of the code. "Google had 1.6M test failures on average each day in the past 15 months, and 73K out of 1.6M (4.56%) test
failures were caused by flaky tests". 

Q3) What is the proposed solution (hypothesis, idea, design)? Why is it believed it will work? How does it represent an
improvement? How is the solution achieved?'

- By employing an approach such that a subset of a diverse set of software projects is used and the last commit of each flaky test is 
used to study the issue, the paper groups the flaky tests into various different categories, identify their causes, proposes fixes.
Through a quantitative percentage evalulation of the number of fixes after proposed solution is implemented, the researchers deduce whether
their solutions work. For example, "14 out of 19 (74%) Test Order Dependency flaky tests are fixed by setting up or cleaning up the state
 shared among the tests."

Q4) What is the author’s evaluation of the solution? What logic, argument, evidence, artifacts (e.g., a proof-of-concept
system), or experiments are presented in support of the idea?

The author provides a very robust methodology for collecting the data of flaky tests in the methodology secition of the paper along with
reasons as to why results can possibly generalized across many software projects. The evaluation is described in the Q3. 

Q5) What is your analysis of the identified problem, idea and evaluation? Is this a good idea? What flaws do you perceive
in the work? What are the most interesting or controversial ideas? For work that has practical implications, ask
whether this will work, who would want it, what it will take to give it to them, and when might it become a reality?

For flaky tests to be identified, a single line cannot be analyzed. Instead, a whole code block that leads up to the line causing flakiness
needs to be studied. Despite the findings, this can still be hectic, time-consuming and difficult to do. In my opinion, developers would not
prioritize doing so. Moreover, automating this could be a hustle even if artificial intelligence of today's day and age is used. However,
the paper's findings would certainly help narrow down on the code that needs to be studied to identify and solve flaky tests fails. Now, another
point to raise is that the study is obviously limited to a certain number of software project repositories. Considering the vastness of 
the software testing field, I am quite sure to believe that there are potentially many other types of flaky tests that did not fall under
the categories derived by this research paper. However, we can almost certainly say (atleast) that the top three categories are most common
areas of flaky test issues. This work would mainly be useful for those programmers who employ a lot of probability in their software modeling
proejcts. This is because there is a lot of randomness and approximate assertion tests which are not deterministic. Moreover, developers that
develop computer systems which run multiple tasks at the same time (concurrency), this would be a useful paper for them to consider.

Q6) What are the paper’s contributions (author’s and your opinion)? Ideas, methods, software, experimental results, experimental techniques...?

This is mostly described in the previous answers. However, for a more quantitative experimental result analysis, the paper section 5.1 provides
a very direct, "to-the-point" description of the results.

Q7) What are future directions for this research (author’s and yours, perhaps driven by shortcomings or other critiques)?
Aiming to address and find the "silver-bullet" solution that can address all categories of flaky tests. 
Using AI to identify flaky tests?

Q8) What questions are you left with? What questions would you like to raise in an open discussion of the work (review
interesting and controversial points, above)? What do you find difficult to understand? List as many as you can, at
least three, not including questions that can be answered quickly by searching the internet

- Assuming the developer employs the solutions and approach to identifying and addressing flaky tests in their code, will the process of doing
so notably save their time or instead make the process more time-consuming such that they would choose ignore these problems.
