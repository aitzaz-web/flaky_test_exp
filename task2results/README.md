# README: Approximate Assertion Detector

## Overview
This script analyzes Python test files within a given project directory to detect and extract approximate assertions. It generates a CSV file containing details of the identified assertions.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later). No additional dependencies are required as the script relies on built-in Python libraries.

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the script on a Python project:

1. **Clone or navigate to your project directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/python/project
   ```

2. **Modify the project name** in the script
   - Locate the line: `project_name = 'sonnet'`
   - Change `'sonnet'` to match the root folder name of your project.

3. **Ensure the script points to the correct test directory**
   - The script assumes test files are located under `project_name/src`.
   - If your test files are in a different directory, update the `test_dir` variable accordingly.

4. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
   Replace `script.py` with the actual filename if it has a different name.

5. **Check the generated CSV file**
   - The script produces an output CSV file named `<project_name>_assertions.csv`.
   - This file contains extracted approximate assertions from test files in the specified directory.

## Output Format
The CSV file contains the following columns:

| Column Name    | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| filepath      | Path to the test file |
| testclass     | Name of the test class (if any) |
| testname      | Name of the test function |
| assertion_type| Type of approximate assertion detected |
| line_number   | Line number where the assertion appears |
| assert_string | Full assertion statement |

## Troubleshooting
- **ERROR: Test directory not found!**
  - Ensure the `test_dir` variable is correctly set.
  - Verify that the test directory exists in your project.
- **SyntaxError when parsing files**
  - Some files may contain syntax errors that prevent proper analysis.
  - The script will skip such files and continue processing others.
