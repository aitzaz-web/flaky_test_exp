## Static Instrumentation Tool

The `static_instrumentation` tool is designed to modify test files by inserting instrumentation code at specific assertion lines. This allows for tracking and analyzing test execution behaviors.

### Running the Static Instrumentation Tool
To run the `static_instrumentation` tool on a test file, use the following command:
```bash
python -m task3results.static_instrumentation <input_test_file> <test_name> <assertion_line> --output <output_file>
```

### Example Usage
There is a file test_example.py. 

Upon running the command in terminal:
```bash
python static_instrumentation.py test_example.py test_function2 23
```

instrumented_test_example.py shows the result



## Script Explanation
The script `script.py` was developed to automate the process of selecting test assertions, instrumenting them, and executing them multiple times while logging results. The key functionalities include:

1. **Selecting Random Assertions:** Reads a CSV file containing test assertion metadata and selects a random subset.
2. **Instrumenting Tests:** Uses the `static_instrumentation` tool to modify test files with additional logging.
3. **Executing Tests:** Runs the instrumented tests multiple times using `pytest` and captures the logs.
4. **Logging Results:** Stores test execution logs for analysis.

### Issues Encountered
While developing and running the script, multiple challenges were encountered, primarily related to module importing issues. Despite repeated attempts, the script did not execute successfully due to:
- Import errors when attempting to use `task3results.static_instrumentation`.
- Unexpected issues in resolving paths to instrumented test files.
- Compatibility issues between different environments and dependencies.

### Conclusion
Although the script did not run successfully, the attempt to implement the logic for selecting, instrumenting, and executing tests is clearly documented. The code structure and approach provide a foundation for further debugging and refinement in future iterations.
